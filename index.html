                <p>A comprehensive directory of buildings, faculty, classes, and other resources targeted at students new to the University of Oregon. The website was built using one of the earliest stable versions of Node.js, and utilized Express.js, MongoDB, and Sencha Touch.</p>
<p>Our most interesting and challenging feature was an embedded interactive campus map. At the time, other services such as Google Maps had not fully indexed the various buildings and landmarks on campus and were still a long ways away from being able to provide walking directions. We created a fuzzy-searchable database of these locations that was able to provide walking directions along the University's sidewalks and lighted paths.</p>

                <p>When the Ducks played in the 2011 BCS National Championships game, the University of Oregon decided to host a watch party in Mac Court for all students. They came to us to create a website that would allow students to register for a limited number of tickets.</p>
<p>We had a little over two weeks to create a website that could handle the impressive amount of traffic UO students will generate for their Ducks, as well as to design and implement a stable ticketing system that we could use on game day.</p>
<p>We built the website in Node.js. It communicated asynchronously with a LaTeX process that generated custom printable tickets and emailed them in real-time to each student. We used QR codes and some simple barcode scanners to process the tickets on game day and check the students in using our custom backend.</p>
<p>The challenge of this project was learning Node.js - at the time, a relatively young platform - well enough to be able to create a robust, stable website all within an extremely short deadline.</p>

                <p>The Outdoor Program website was my first project as a solo developer. Myself and a designer interacted directly with the client to conceptualize and construct a brand-new website for the University of Oregon Outdoor Program.</p>
<p>The web site was written in Node.js using the Express framework, and boasts a custom CMS, robust search functionality, and a pretty snappy image server with inferred resizing capability.</p>

                <p>Designed to help divorcing couples learn how to help their children during this period of difficult transition, Children in Between is a guided course of videos, activities, and quizzes designed by Donald Gordon and implemented by us.</p>
<p>Completion of our online course was often required by courts, which made stability and accessibility our top priority. The website, including all audio and video assets, is fully multilingual.</p>

<p>The site's users worked through a series of activities, many of them involving complex interactions. Their progress was tracked and reported to their assigned counselor, and they were encouraged to go back and revisit activities they found particularly helpful.</p>
<p>By far the most significant challenge of this project was designing the Backbone.js-driven clientside application to allow for a varied array of activities while maintaining consistency for both the end user and future developers. Cross-browser compatibility</p>
