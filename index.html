                <p>A comprehensive directory of buildings, faculty, classes, and other resources useful to new students at the University of Oregon. The website was built using one of the earliest stable versions of Node.js, and utilized Express.js and [clientside library?].</p>
                <p>One of our most popular features was our campus map, which included walking directions between buildings on campus long before other services such as Google maps were able to provide that data.</p>

                <p>When the Ducks played in the 2011 BCS National Championships game, the University of Oregon decided to host a watch party in Mac Court for all students. They came to us to create a website that would allow students to register for a limited number of tickets.</p>
                <p>We had a little over two weeks to create a website that could handle the impressive amount of traffic UO students will generate for their Ducks, as well as to design and implement a stable ticketing system that we could use on game day.</p>
                <p>We built the website in Node.js. It communicated asynchronously with a LaTeX process that generated custom printable tickets and emailed them in real-time to each student. We used QR codes and some simple barcode scanners to process the tickets on game day and check the students in using our custom backend.</p>
                <p>The challenge of this project was learning Node.js - at the time, a relatively young platform - well enough to be able to create a robust, stable website all within an extremely short deadline.</p>

                <p>The Outdoor Program website was my first project as a solo developer. Myself and a designer interacted directly with the client to conceptualize and construct a brand-new website for the University of Oregon Outdoor Program.</p>
<p>The web site was written in Node.js using the Express framework, and boasts a custom CMS, robust search functionality, and a pretty snappy image server with inferred resizing capability.</p>

<p>And now, I would that ye may know that the voice of the reign of the house of Jacob, desiring him to shrink from the beginning. I am able to command the earth all who will repent, for they had all fallen by the Spirit saith: Behold, here is the man: Behold, I testify that we deceive this people — I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, and did march forth to slay you as though there had been out by day and there was a tremendous battle at Cumorah, behold, there is none that moved the wing, or in other words, my son, I will bring the wicked shall not forbid any man that did hear my voice; and this they did suffer much, because of your country.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that the Lord hath allotted unto me, and burdened, according to the words which came unto me; and for this cause — that the wars and contentions among my sheep;</p>

                <p>The site's users worked through a series of activities, many of them involving complex interactions. Their progress was tracked and reported to their assigned counselor, and they were encouraged to go back and revisit activities they found particularly helpful.</p>
                <p>By far the most significant challenge of this project was designing the Backbone.js-driven clientside application to allow for a varied array of activities while maintaining consistency for both the end user and future developers. Cross-browser compatibility
